## Who we are
Open Source Info is a bunch of people with the idea to create a centralized platform of documentation. This website is aimed to have documentation about:
* AWS
* Jenkins
* Linux
* Rust
* And much more!

## How to contribute
To contribute to this project it's simple: 
1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a new post with the categories and tags empty.
3. Create a pull request.

## Limits
There are no limits. You can create a post of the theme you want. If you want to create a post about asynchronous execution in nodeJS or a post about Azure Basics, just do it. Create a pull request on our GitHub with a post written in markdown and we will do the rest.
