## Addition
Variales are names given to computer memory location where your store data in a program. In Rust, we define variables with `let`:
```rust
fn main() {
	let add = 8 + 11;
}
```
## Substraction
```rust
fn main() {
	let subs = 1 - 1;
}
```
## Multiplication
```rust
fn main() {
	let mult = 8 * 9;
}
```
## Division
```rust
fn main() {
	let div = 4 / 6;
}
```
## Remainder
```rust
fn main() {
	let tem = 3 % 2;
}
```
